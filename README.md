Description:
PetzPS3 is an exciting initiative aimed at rekindling the nostalgia cherished by virtual pet enthusiasts who fondly remember Petz2 (Dogz 2 and Catz 2) on PlayStation 2. Our mission is to seamlessly transition this beloved gaming experience from PS2 mainly (and Wii) to the PlayStation 3, for this unusual game.

The main idea of ​​making this experience accessible to a new generation of players, as well as those looking to remember their childhood or youth, PetzPS3 firmly upholds the principles of legitimacy. 

We do not support piracy; Rather, we provide a legal avenue for people who lack backwards compatible consoles or for those who have lost access to prized games due to outdated hardware.

Central to our vision is the preservation of this treasured adventure for posterity. Recognizing the lack of subsequent open world titles featuring these endearing creatures from the developer studio, we are committed to ensuring the accessibility and continued enjoyment of this experience for all who appreciate it.

PetzPS3 makes Petz2 replayable on PlayStation 3 easier.
